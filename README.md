##🚀 Future Enhancements

The Mini HRMS app can grow into a more complete system over time. Some exciting improvements we plan to add:

Build reusable UI components → Create a shared design system for consistency across the app.

Manage state effectively → Use advanced state management (like Redux or Context API) for smoother data flow.

Work with forms, validations, and API data → Enhance employee forms with strong validation rules and backend integration.

Apply React best practices → Make the app production-ready by following industry standards.

Employee Detail Page → Allow users to click on an employee to view their complete profile, including department, role, and status.

UI/UX Improvements → Ensure a neat, user-friendly, and fully responsive layout across all devices.
